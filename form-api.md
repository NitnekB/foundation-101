# API Form endpoint

Setting it up is easy and free. Here's how:

### 1. Choose a service

We are going to take [formkeep](https://formkeep.com/). Create your account now.

### 1. Setup the HTML form

Change your form's `action`attribute to this and replace your@email.com with your own email.

```
https://formspree.io/your@email.com
```

### 2. Add a name attribute to every field

Ensure all `<input>`, `<select>` and `<textarea>` elements inside your form have a name attribute, otherwise you will not receive the data filled in these fields.

### 3. Submit the form and confirm your email address

Go to your website and submit the form once. This will send you an email asking to confirm your email address.

_Remember that if you display the same form in multiple URLs of your site you'll have to confirm it multiple times!_

### 4. All set, receive emails

From now on, when someone submits that form, we'll forward you the data as email.
